                A better education system is the answer to most of the worldâ€™s problems. In the context of world hunger, education can provide
                 better opportunities and more access to income and food. Additionally, some countries have food-for-education programs 
                 where students are given free food for coming to school.One of the simplest ways to combat world hunger is to initiate more food
                  collection drives.Another way to fight global hunger is to encourage foreign nations to be more focused on government intervention 
                  programs like those that provide food to mothers and children in poor areas.

            <p id="two"><b>CLIMATE CHANGE</b><br>
                The main causes of climate change are globalwarming, environmental pollution.We can prevent climate change by switching
                out main energy sources to clean and renewable energy. Many methods exist to prevent, control and reduce environmental pollution
                which in turn helps us to prevent environmental pollution, in particular by reducing the consumption of fossil fuels, and limiting 
                industry emissions and waste.
